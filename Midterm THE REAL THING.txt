Midterm Notes:

Q5:
Write the prototype for a function named "volume".
This function takes 3 integers that represent the length, width, and height of a box.
The return value is a reference to an integer.
The length parameter has a default value of 5 and the height parameter has a default of 8.
There is no default value for the width.

int& volume(int length = 5, int width, int height = 8);

Q11:
Given a class named Fidget, write the declaration (prototype) for operator*=.
This operator is a non-member (i.e. global) function and the right operand is another Fidget.


Fidget operator*=(Fidget &a);

Q12:
Vector2D operator++(){
	this.x += 1;
	this.y += 1;
}

Q13:
friend iostream& operator<<(iostream& stream, Vector2D& a);


Q14:

iostream& operator<<(iostream& stream, Vector2D& a){
	stream << "(" << a.x << "," << a.y << ")";
	
	return stream;
}

Q26:
8 ladies go to 
/*eight shops at 
eight o'clock in the morning.*/

only have eight pounds between them. 

Each lady wants to buy 8 spiders. 
	For each spider, = 8 pence
		eight spider shoes must also be bought. = 8 pence each shoe
		
Each spider costs eight pence and each spider shoe costs an eighth pence each.

240 pence per pound! 

The journey costs eight pence per stop
and is made up of eight stops.


Will the ladies have enough change for the bus home?

TOTAL MONEY = 1920
MONEY PER LADY = 240

TOTAL SPIDERS = 8 * 8 = 64
TOTAL SPIDER SHOES = SPIDERS * 8 = 512

TOTAL COST OF SPIDER SHOES = 512 * 8 = 4096
TOTAL COST OF SPIDERS = 64 * 8 = 512
TOTAL COST FOR SPIDERS + SHOES = 4608

BUS COST ONE WAY FOR ALL 8 = 8 * 8 * 8 = 512
BUS COST ROUND TRIP FOR ALL = 512 * 2 = 1024

TOTAL COST OF ALL SHENAGANS = 4608 + 1024 = 5632

1920 < 5632 so the answer is they don't even have enough to buy the spiders
