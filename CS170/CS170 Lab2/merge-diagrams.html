</p></li><li><b>Pseudocode</b> There are a variety of ways to approach this. This is just an overview of the
	things that you are going to do. Some of the details have been left out, but you should be able
	to write C++ code from the description below. As always <b>DRAW DIAGRAMS</b>. You will not get 
	any help from a TA if you are working without diagrams. 
	
<blockquote><pre>Setup a pointer to the first node of the left list. (left) 
Setup a pointer to the first node of the right list (right)
Setup a pointer to point to the head of the new list. (This pointer will only be set once.)
Setup a pointer to point to the tail of the new list. (This will be updated every time you add a node to the new list).

While both pointers (left and right) are pointing at a node
  Compare the value of the left node with the right node
  If the left node is less than or equal to the right node, 
    Place the left node in the new list
    Move the left pointer to the next node
  Else  (The left node is greater than the right node)
    Place the right node in the new list
    Move the right pointer to the next node
  End If
End While

If the right side is empty and the left side still has nodes
  Add all of the nodes from the left side to the end of the list
If the left side is empty and the right side still has nodes
  Add all of the nodes from the right side to the end of the list

Make sure to update any other members before returning.

<b>Other hints</b>:<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure you can handle the case when either the left or right list is empty.</li>
<li>The lists are unlikely to be the same length, so don't assume that fact.</li>
<li>Make sure the rhs list is empty afterwards. If you are storing a counter in that list, make
  sure you set the count to 0.</li>
</ul>
