<li><b>Question:<br>
In the <tt>copy</tt> function, you provide two ranges, but only the first one has an end. What happens
if the second range isn't large enough to hold all of the items? Do we have to check for that case?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
You are not given an end to the second range because you don't need it. If the first range is larger than
the second range, <i>bad things will happen</i>. This is by design. Remember, this is C++ and the programmer
is always right (and speed comes first.) Also, realize that you <b>cannot</b> check to see if the second range is large enough as you only
are given a pointer to the start.
<p>
Another reason why we aren't going to worry about bad behavior is because this is how the STL is implemented,
and you are trying to understand How Things Work<sup>&trade;</sup>.

<li><b>Question:<br>
Are we allowed to create a new array for any of the functions?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Absolutely not. Not now, not ever. No. All of the modifications are to be made on the ranges that
you are provided. You are not to create any arrays. <b>In fact, you are not to use the subscript
operator <tt>[]</tt> in any code</b>. Why? Because you may not be given an array. Remember, this
is a template function and you have no idea what data structure will be provided.

<li><b>Question:<br>
How many functions are we supposed to implement? Some of my functions can be overloaded or can
be written with multiple template parameters.
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
The driver shows you what functions need to be created. (This is sort of what's called <i>Test Driven Development</i>, where you're given the test
cases and you need to make them all work.)
As stated in the handout, NO OVERLOADED FUNCTIONS ARE ALLOWED. As you said, if you are using only one template
parameter, <tt><b>T</b></tt>, then some functions may need to be overloaded, but you're not allowed to do that. These functions can use two template 
parameters, <tt><b>T1</b></tt> and <tt><b>T2</b></tt>, and won't need to be overloaded.
